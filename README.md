# week-1-challenge

For this project I refactored the code of this website to follow the accessibilty criteria as decribed in the acceptance criteria.

These criteria were as follows

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In order to satisfy these criteria, I added 'alt' tags to all of the images and provided the code with a more concise and descriptive title.

These are some screenshots from my website
